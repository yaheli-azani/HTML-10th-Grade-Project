    Wardell "Stephen" Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and brother of current NBA player Seth Curry, however he is easily the greatest player of all his family members. He is a consensus top 2 point guard of all time, his only competitor for the position is Magic Johnson. When he was drafted in 2009 nobody knew he would be a star and he had to work to get to where he did. He stuck with the team who drafted him, the Golden State Warriors, for his entire career so far. He was a big part of arguably the best two teams in NBA history and is competing in the finals this year. He is also a part of some of the greatest MVP seasons of all time. Such as in 2016 where he averaged 30.1 points, 6.7 assists and 2.1 steals per game all on 46.8% on shots, 56.6% on 3pt shots, and 90.8% from the free throw line. He lead his team to 73-9 record, which is the greatest regular season record of all time. For his carreer he averaged 24.3 points, 6.5 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 0.2 blocks per game. He is also a 2 time MVP and a 3 time champion, and is regarded as the greatest shooter to ever touch a basketball.

   Curry has an iconic moment where he comes back into a game after being injured in 2016 vs a formidable Oklahoma City Thunder Team down 12 in the 4th quarter. He scored 46 points on the night including the 32 foot shot that won them the game in overtime. During the shot great NBA commentator let out his iconic "BANG" call not once but twice.
