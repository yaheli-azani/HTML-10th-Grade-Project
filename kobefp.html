   Kobe "Bean" Bryant is widely considered the greatest Laker of all time, which is a huge achievement because the Lakers have had more talent than any other team in the NBA. He was drafted in the historic 1996 NBA draft and played all the way until 2016, his career was ended early due to an achilles tear in 2013. He is known for being the apprentice of Michael Jordan and for his insane work ethic. There are countless stories from NBA players who tell of the times Kobe outworked them. His nickname was the "Black Mamba" and due to this people who follow Kobe's insane work ethic are said to have the "Mamba Mentality". Unfortunately, on January 26, 2020, he tragically passed in a helicopter crash along with 8 others including his daughter Gianna. For his career Kobe averages 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.5 blocks per game. This is very impressive considering he played 20 seasons in the NBA. Kobe Bryant and his mentality influenced many people and even other players, such as Jayson Tatum (a young star) who is playing in the finals this year.

  Kobe Bryant is also known for his success with another all time great, Shaquille O'Neal aka Shaq, aka the "Big Diesel". They are arguably the greatest duo of all time, winning 3 championships together and splitting up due to chemistry issues. After they split up they became the most fun rivalry in the league for a while, however in the 2010s they made up and became great friends. 
  In January 2006 Kobe put on a show against the Toronto Raptors. At first, during what seemed like a normal game Toronto lead the Lakers 63-49 at the half. Kobe only had 26 points, however he was about to explode for what is today considered the greatest scoring performance of all time, he had 55 points in the second half and willed his team to an 18 point win. He ended the game with 81 points, second only to Wilt Chamberlain's 100 point game. (Wilt faced significantly worse competition and the other team let him score so he'd get 100).
