  <p class="middle">Among his four NBA championships was the famous 2016 finals where the significantly worse Cleveland Cavaliers (including Lebron) faced off against the greatest regular season team of all time the 73 win 9 losses (NBA record) Golden State Warriors. The Warriors were hot after they came off a 3-1 series (first to 4) comeback against the up and coming Oklahoma City Thunder. The Cavaliers went down 3 games to 1 early and everyone wrote off Lebron and the Cavaliers. Then in the 5th game Lebron James and his teammate, Kyrie Irving, scored 40 points each and won the game. They went on to tie the series 3-3 and then win game 7 off of a clutch three late in the game by Kyrie. Before this clutch three the warriors almost converted on a fast break layup until Lebron ran at incredible speed and flew in to swat the shot off the glass, this is known as "the block" and to this day people imitate the announcer who excitedly yelled "BLOCKED BY JAMES". This is known as Lebron's greatest achievement and gave us many iconic moments, among them was Lebron fulfilling his promise to make Cleveland a city of champions. </p>

   However before the mid 2010s and all the great accomplishments Lebron achieved this decade he was seen as a villain. In 2010 Lebron held an hour long show where the focus was Lebron's next team. Here he informed the entire world that he would not return to the Cavaliers, who drafted him, and that he is leaving them to team up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat. Lebron was hated as he left the team who drafted him to create a "super team" in Miami. Lebron became the villain of the NBA. However Lebron had an all time choke in the 2011 NBA finals where the heavily favored Miami Heat lost to the underdog Dallas Mavericks. Lebron was ridiculed as the Heat lost due to his awful play. The next year, in 2012, the Heat were down 3-2 to the Boston Celtics and were on the verge of losing again, but this time Lebron showed up. This game is reffered to as the "Legacy game" becuase Lebron's entire legacy depended on this game. Lebron poured in 45 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 assists on incredible efficiency and the Heat won that series and went on to win a championship, Lebrons first. In this game Lebron had an infamous stare into the camera which just showed how locked in he was.
