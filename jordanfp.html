    Michael Jeffrey Jordan is the only player, besides Lebron James, to be considered in the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) debate. He played in the NBA from the mid 80s to early 2000s but is mostly known for his other wordly stretch in the 90s. He is widely known as the kid who came out of college and dominated the NBA. As a rookie he averaged a whopping 28.2 points per game, 5.9 assists, and 6.5 rebounds. He took a bulls team, who had been struggling for a long time, to 6 NBA championship wins with 0 losses in the finals. This insane winning streak included 2 seperate three-peats (3 Championship wins in a row), which is even more insane when you think about all the incredible teams who struggled to win two straight let alone three. In total he averages 30.1 points, 5.3 assists, 6.2 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, and 2.3 steals per game.

    Michael Jodan has many iconic moments in his career, such as the "flu game" where Michael Jordan played through a very intense case if the flu and put on a show giving his team the win while barely being able to stand stright. Another example is "the shot" which was a game winner scored by MJ to win his 6th championship, seal his second three-peat, and making him 6-0 in the finals. Many more of these moments were brought to light in the recently release "Last Dance" documentary. Jordan has left an immense impact on the world, as to this day people fight over the GOAT debate and wear Jordans.
