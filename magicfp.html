    Earvin "Magic" Johnson was a 6'9 point guard who was drafted in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. Magic was able to revive a beat lakers squad who were a middle of the pack franchise at the time. They had come off of many finals losses to the Boston Celtics and needed somebody to revive the organization. Magic Johnson was the answer; he took them from a team bad enough to get the 1st pick in the draft to the champions that very year. He brought a new spirit to LA, he brought upon the "showtime" era in LA. It was a flashy, up tempo, run and gun style of play that the Lakers used from 1979-1991. Led by Magic's passing abilities and Karrem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring abilities the team utilized fast breaks and won five NBA championships. Johnson is considered the greatest passer of all time and one of the greatest basketball minds of all time. unfortunately, while at the top of his game in 1991 Magic was diagnosed with HIV. He had to retire right after and figure out what to do with his life. While he tried returning to the game in 1996, it didn't work out well, as he only played 32 games and retired again. However he still had a legendary career. He was so dominant that the NBA named their new western conference finals MVP award after him. He averaged 19.5 points, 11.2 assists, 7.2 rebounds, 1.9 steals, and 0.4 blocks per game for his career. He was also apart of the Olympic "Dream Team" in 1992 where they cruised to a gold medal. Big names such as Magic, Michael Jordan, and Larry Bird were featured on this team.

    Magic Johnson of the Lakers in known for his rivalry with Larry Bird of the Celtics. 2 rival teams who met in the finals a lot and 2 rival players who were compared a lot. Each wanted to prove their dominance, and even to this day people compare the teams and players. He is also known for his insane game 6 performance in the 1980 NBA finals during his rookie year. The Lakers were up 3-2 however their star Kareem Abdul Jabbar was injured and couldn't play. Everyone thought that the rookie couldn't handle the pressure and that due to the Laker's lack of big man depth they would lose. Magic told his coach to put him in at the Center position even though he normally played Point Guard. He put up 42 points, 15 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals, and 1 block to seal the win for the Lakers and Finals MVP in his first year. To this day this is considered one of the greatest NBA finals performances of all time.
